## Our Consultants

### Claus Herther
Hi, my name is Claus Herther, and I've been a recovering Fortune 100 employee for over 15 years. I'm now a consultant in business intelligence, data analytics and machine learning.

My clients include household names, such as Universal Studios and Netflix, as well as lesser known companies that are using data in all kinds of innovative and exciting ways. What excites me at work is when a simple solution has immediate business impact.

What excites me outside of work is the simplicity of a hike on a beautiful sunny Southern California day.

Contact me via [email](mailto:claus@calogica.com) or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clausherther) to talk about how we can help you with your data challenges!
