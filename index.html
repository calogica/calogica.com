Calogica provides data and analytics consulting for small to medium-size businesses in the Southern California region.

Working with clients in a variety of industries, we have extensive experience developing dashboards and reports in business intelligence tools like Tableau, MicroStrategy, Periscope, Mode Analytics and Looker.

We work with relational databases, such as MySql, PostgreSQL and SQL Server, and really enjoy working with data warehouse platforms such as AWS Redshift and Snowflake.

We also help our clients build predictive models for Customer Retention, Lifetime Value, Campaign Attribution and Performance, probabilistic Demand Prediction, as well as custom Machine Learning applications in Python or R. (We're also very excited about Julia...!)

We'd love to [chat](mailto:info@calogica.com) with you about how we can help you with your data challenges!
