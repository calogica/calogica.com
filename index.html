<p>This repository is a collection of data and data science-related projects that I hope you'll find interesting or helpful.
    They're using Python, Julia and R in Jupyter Notebooks to explore relationships and models in data.

<p>My name is Claus and I've been a recovering Fortune 100 employee for 10 years. I'm now a consultant in the business intelligence and data analytics, with half a foot in machine learning.
    My clients include household names, such as Universal Studios and Netflix, as well as lesser known companies that are using data in all kinds of innovative and exciting ways.
    What excites me at work is when a simple solution has immediate business impact.
What excites me outside of work is the simplicity of a hike on a beautiful sunny Southern California day.</p>
