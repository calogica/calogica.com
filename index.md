**Calogica** provides data and analytics consulting for small to medium-size businesses.

Working with [clients](/clients) in a variety of industries over the last 15 years, we have extensive experience integrating disparate data sources and developing data warehouses from scratch. We understand "small" to "big" data and can help you build out a scalable data analytics platform.

We really enjoy working with cloud-based data warehouse platforms like **Snowflake** and **BigQuery** and will help you integrate application data from Postgres, MySQL and all your SaaS platforms into your data warehouse. In addition, we have experience integrating data from event collectors such as **Snowplow** and **Segment**, as well as Google Analytics and GA360 and can work with your custom app instrumentation events.

Using our favorite data transformation tool **dbt**, we help you build a scalable and easy to maintain data pipeline.

Whether you use **Tableau**, **Looker**, Periscope or Mode Analytics, we can help implement your business intelligence solution.

For clients with advanced analytics needs, we also help build predictive models for **Customer Lifetime Value**, **Campaign Attribution**, **Demand Forecasts**, as well as custom Machine Learning applications in Python or R.

We'd love to [chat](/about) with you about how we can help you with your [data challenges](/services)!


Proud to be partnering with:
