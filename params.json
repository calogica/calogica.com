{"name":"Claus Herther","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to my GitHub page.\r\nThis project repository is a collection of data and data science-related projects that I hope you'll find interesting or helpful. They're using Python, scikit-learn and Jupyter Notebooks (and possibly some R down the road) to explore relationships and models in data. \r\nSome of these examples come from courses I'm taking as part of the Masters in Predictive Analytics program at Northwestern University where I'm currently enrolled. Others have been inspired by blog posts around the internet, such yhat or FiveThirtyEight.\r\n\r\n### About me.\r\nMy name is Claus and I've been a recovering Fortune 100 employee for 10 years. I'm now a consultant in the business intelligence and sometimes 'big data' world, with half a foot in machine learning. My clients include household names, such as Universal Studios and Netflix, as well as companies you've never heard of but are using data in all kinds of innovative and exciting ways. What excites me at work is when a simple solution has immediate business impact. \r\nWhat excites me outside of work is the simplicity of a hike on a beautiful sunny Southern California day.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
