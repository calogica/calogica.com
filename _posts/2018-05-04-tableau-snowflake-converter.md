Working with clients on migrating their Tableau dashboards from Redshift to **Snowflake**, I ended up writing this little helper in Python that does much of the boring work for us.

I decided to [share the repo here](https://github.com/clausherther/tableau_snowflake_conversion) since nobody likes manually modifying XML. I'd love to hear any feedback on this, or feel free to fork and submit a PR.
