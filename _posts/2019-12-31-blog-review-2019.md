When I started writing blog posts in 2018, I thought this was mostly going to be for clients and/or myself so I can refer to my own posts later. 18 months later, I'm thrilled that thousands of you from around the world find the content compelling. 

- **Over 12,000 people from 140 countries** have stopped by the blog over the last year. This is small potatoes in comparison to other blogs, but compared to the number of folks that I expected to read the posts (somewhere between 1 and 12 of my closest friends and other people I guilt into reading them), this is a great sign that the Internet still works the way I thought it did.

- **80% of traffic comes from Organic Search.** Seeing the popularity of posts about SQL and Snowflake (see Top 10 below), it seems that there is an opportunity to provide even more value around the topics in 2020.
- While most of the traffic, predictably, comes from the U.S., **over 45% comes from non-US** countries, with **India** leading the way. While still small, I'm particular thrilled that some 150 people from various **African** countries (mostly South Africa) have found one or two posts compelling enough to read.
