## [2020 Crystal Ball: Predictions for the Economy, Politics, Technology, and More | Fortune](https://fortune.com/2019/12/02/2020-predictions-recession-presidential-race-technology-climate-change/)
Some of these seem more like predictions for the 20s decade (yes, that's happening soon!), but still a good read.

## [Newsvendor Problem – The Tale of the First Formula in the Textbook | Stitch Fix Technology – Multithreaded](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2019/11/21/newsvendor-model/)

My favorite part of this post, aside from it being very good, is that *Eric Colson* got image credit for this:

## [How To Mathematically Win Every Office Bet](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-mathematically-win-every-office-bet-bf9727f87395)

Unlikely you'll be able to pull this off very often in real life, but a fun read on what is essentially an options strategy for your office bets
> Suppose we make a second $$5 bet with person B, but this time instead of predicting it to rain more than two inches, we bet that it will rain less than four. Now, if it rains 4 or more, we lose $$5, and anything less we profit $$5. What’s interesting that occurs here is the regions beyond 2 and 4 have conflicting payouts and losses, so when we lose one bet, we win the other. Then, in the region between, we win both.

This *could* come in handy when betting on some of the 2020 predictions above.

## [Big Calculator: How Texas Instruments Monopolized Math Class](https://gen.medium.com/big-calculator-how-texas-instruments-monopolized-math-class-67ee165045dc)

Speaking of math and betting, you may need a calculator for those odds, and chances are you're using a Texas Intruments calculator. (For you finance nerds, I know, you'll be using the HP12C.)
Nevermind, you'll be using your phone. I'm dating myself here.

## [Democratic Primaries: Preferential Poll Results — Swayable](https://swayable.com/insights/primaries2019)

Interesting analysis and visualization of indirect vote choices by candidate.

## [LAPD takes page from Batman, using tethers that wrap suspects’ bodies - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-12-03/lapd-new-restraint-device)
Holy taser.
