## ;tldr
Harsh news flash:
- Having a Chief Data Officer does not make you data-driven
- Having a Machine Learning product does not make you data-driven
- Having a KPI dashboard does not make you data-driven

## Know Thy Numbers
If you stopped someone on the hallway, would they have an idea of what your key metric was for yesterday?

## Curiosity
Do your employees seek out data? Are they asking deeper and deeper question of the data?
Do you debate the value of metric A vs metric B?
When you send out daily/weekly metrics (and of course you do), do they regularly lead to spirited back and forths over Slack/email when a metric spikes/drops?
Does your management relentlessly try to improve their understanding of what led to outcome Y?

## Hold 'Em (Accountable)
Do you talk about metrics in your 1:1 meetings with your team? I'm not talking about KPIs in your "Quarterly Goals" PowerPoint deck. No, do you ask questions like "Bob, I noticed metric X dropped last week by 5%. What's contributing to that?" This is not about calling out someone, it's about having a common language and guidepost of success for the org.

## Risky Business
Do you quantify risk? Do you frame decisions in terms of probabilities? Do you quantify your big bets?
No Poker player worth their chips goes into a hand without an clear understanding of the probabilities of the outcome of every possible hand and a clear system of sizing bets. (Kelly Criterion).

## With Freedom Comes Responsibility
Do you give all your employees access to all/some of your data? Do you feel you can trust them with that much access? Do your employees feel ownership of data and metrics at every level?
